# Radar
I will make a radar with an Arduino uno, HY-srf05 ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor. I know, it is basically a sonar.
## How to use
- Use radar v2 and Draw_radarv2 for the working product (radar is a sonar amd mesures distance)
- Control that you use the correct usb port, the preset in the code is COM5 (You can change that to your preference)
- Send the C++ code from radar v2 to the Arduino
- Start the Processing code in Processing 3
## Software
- Processing 3 download link: https://processing.org/download/
- Visual studio code  download link:https://code.visualstudio.com/
## Parts used
- Ultrasonic Sensor: HY-SRF05 
- Servo: SM-S2309S
- Arduino: UNO R3
